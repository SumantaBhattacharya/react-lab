# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

How can we pass the data from one Component to another Component in React.js?

useState Hook

Render with arguments

props ✅

PropTypes

Explanation

props is used to pass data from one component to another.

Passing props makes it easy to send data from parent to child components in a straightforward, unidirectional way.

By using props, you can create flexible and reusable components that accept dynamic data, making your code more modular.
